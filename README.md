Welcome. Your objective is to analyse the following [random] image, and report back the color of the image.

You will submit the answer back to the image page (under POST), using the variables:

The color variable is divided into 3 numbers. These 3 RGB numbers should be separated with a semi-colon ( ; ).

You have one second to analyse the image, and submit it back to the image page.

Good luck!
